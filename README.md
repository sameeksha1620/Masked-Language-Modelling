# Masked-Language-Modelling

## Description
The Masked Language Modeling Project demonstrates the power of Hugging Face's Transformers library for masked language modeling. This project showcases the ability of a fine-tuned language model to predict missing words in sentences where certain words are masked. By inputting sentences with masked words, users can observe the model's predictions and witness real-time text generation.

## Key Features
- **Masked Language Modeling:** Utilize Hugging Face Transformers to create and fine-tune a language model capable of predicting masked words in sentences.
- **User Interaction:** Users can interact with the model by entering sentences with masked words and receiving predictions for the missing tokens.

## Usage
1. **Installation:** Install the required libraries by running `pip install transformers`.

2. **Model Training:** Train the masked language model using the Transformers library with your choice of data and parameters.

3. **Text Generation:** Use the trained model to generate text by inputting sentences with masked words.

## Project Code
The project's code initializes the masked language model using the Transformers library. Users input sentences with masked words, and the model generates predictions, demonstrating real-time text generation.

## Benefits
- **Educational:** Understand the concepts and applications of masked language modeling in natural language processing.
- **Interactive:** Experiment with the model's capabilities without needing to write code, making the project accessible to a broader audience.

## Gradio Interface
The project also integrates Gradio, a Python library for creating intuitive web interfaces, to allow users to interact with the language model in real-time.

## Further Customization
Extend the project by fine-tuning the model on specific tasks, integrating additional datasets, or enhancing the user interface for diverse user interactions.
